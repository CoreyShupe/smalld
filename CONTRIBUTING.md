# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to SmallD!

We welcome contributions of all sizes from people of all abilities.
When participating in the community please keep that in mind as well as the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

If you've **found a bug or issue** with the code, then [open an issue](https://github.com/princesslana/smalld/issues/new) on github.
Be sure to clearly describe what you expected to happen and what actually happened.
Include an example of code that can reproduce the issue, along with any logs or error messages (double check that your bot token isn't in these).

If you have a **feature request** then [open an issue](https://github.com/princesslana/smalld/issues/new) describing the feature you wish to see included.
Any context you can provide such as why you need this feature or how the feature would look in code is very useful.

If you wish to **submit code** for a fix or feature use the [fork/PR](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) process to make your change and submit the pull request.
Include context about the fix or feature and the change will be reviewed when possible.
Be prepared to answer questions or respond to comments on your changes, and be patient as sometimes there will be delays.

If you wish to **update documentation** use the same process as for submitting a fix or feature, as all the documentation is generated from the repository also.

If you wish to **develop a library or wrapper for another programming language** based on SmallD then please reach out to the contact details at the end of this doc.
We may have some advice or comments, but of course you're welcome to develop your great idea on your own, we'd be excited to hear about it.
